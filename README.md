# Password-Locker
This project is built using pyperclip module of python.
You probably have accounts on many different websites. It’s a bad habit to use the same password for  each of them. It’s best to use password manager on your computer where you can copy any account password to the clipboard and paste it into the website’s Password field.
Only the account whose password you have stored in the program can be used to copy the password.
